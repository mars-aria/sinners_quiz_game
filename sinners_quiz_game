    print("'There are legends of people born with the gift of making music so true, it can pierce the veil between life and death; conjuring spirits from the past... and the future. In ancient Ireland, they were called FilÃ­. In Choctaw land, they called them Fire Keepers. And in West Africa, they were called Griots. This gift can bring healing to their communities. But it also, attracts evil [...] How haints work: they switch places with the soul of a man. But vampires are different; maybe the worst kind [of evil creatures]. The soul gets stuck in the body. Can't rejoin the ancestors. Cursed to live here with all this hate. Can't even feel the warmth of a sunrise.' \n")

        "3) Is their new favorite song suddenly 'Pick Poor Robin Clean'?",
        "4) Have you noticed any red blood stains on their clothing?",
        "5) Are there visible bite marks on their skin?",

        "7) Do they drool uncontrollably?",
        "8) Do their teeth look as sharp as a shark's?",
        "9) Do they suddenly sound like a pacifist, preaching ideals such as 'Being kind to one another!'?",
        "10) Have they recently suffered from a fatal injury, but heal quickly and try to act like nothing's amiss?",
        "11) Do they witness the death of someone else in front of them but appear indifferent or unbothered?",
        "12) Has calling you 'Baby' in a seductive tone quickly become their new favorite catchphrase?",
        "13) Can they suddenly sense your emotions as if they're an empath?",
