My final project titled "Is You Is or Is You Ain't, My Baby? (A 'Sinners' Horror Quiz Game)" for the Code in Place course at Stanford University. Inspired by director Ryan Coogler's horror film "Sinners", this interactive quiz game helps users identify if their loved one is a vampire by asking a series of scenario and behavioral-based questions about the undead. Can you survive the night at Club Juke?
